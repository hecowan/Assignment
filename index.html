		<h1>Welcome to my site.<br> Please come in and stay awhile.</h1>

		<p>I started this web site because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the last year,
		I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.
		<br>
		<br>
		If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And
		if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>
